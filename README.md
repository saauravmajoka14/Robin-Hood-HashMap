# Robin-Hood-HashMap
-> Built a custom Cpp library to optimise HashMap functionalities such as lookup, unsuccessful lookup, insertion and deletion, in that order of preference.
-> Utilised Robin Hood hashing and linear open addressing to decrease complexity.
-> Custom Robinâ€‘Hood Flat HashMap outperforms traditional Cpp map by a factor of 3 and Number of collisions are negligible as compared to unordered_map.

TIME COMPLEXITY:
1. LOOK UP TIME : Average O(1) and Worst case O(n)
2. Insertion: O(1) 
3. Deletion: O(1)
